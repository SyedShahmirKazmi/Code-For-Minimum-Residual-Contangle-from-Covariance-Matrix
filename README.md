# Code-For-Minimum-Residual-Contangle-from-Covariance-Matrix
It took me time to understand the necessary step needed to write code for triparty entanglement, so here the code which is correct according to my current understanding. I want to advance this code repository for more higher parties entanglement. In case of any issue in the code, so email me at: shahmir.kazmi64@gmail.com
